An Engineer's Dive into the Underwater World üåäWelcome to the repository for "An Engineer's Dive into the Underwater World," an interactive web-based presentation created to introduce fellow engineers and enthusiasts to the fascinating physics, physiology, and skills behind freediving and scuba diving.This project transforms a standard slideshow into an engaging, self-contained web experience, complete with dynamic content generated by the Gemini API.‚û°Ô∏è View the Live Presentation Here: https://abadredd.github.io/diving-presentation/‚ú® FeaturesThis isn't just a static set of slides. This presentation includes:Interactive Navigation: A clean, user-friendly interface to move between slides.Embedded Media: Seamlessly integrated video and illustrations to explain complex topics like negative buoyancy and human anatomy.Gemini-Powered Dive Site Assistant: An interactive slide where users can input a location and receive AI-generated suggestions for world-famous dive sites.Dynamic Safety Quiz Generator: A feature that calls the Gemini API to create unique, relevant safety questions on demand, reinforcing the presentation's key takeaways.Responsive Design: The presentation is designed to look great on any screen size, from a mobile phone to a large projector.üî¨ Topics CoveredThe presentation provides a technical yet accessible overview of key diving concepts, including:Fundamental Physics: Boyle's Law, Archimedes' Principle, and the effects of pressure.Freediving Physiology: The Mammalian Dive Reflex, the "Urge to Breathe" vs. Blackout, and the dangers of hyperventilation.Scuba Diving Principles: The mechanics of scuba gear, the risks of lung overexpansion, and the effects of nitrogen (Narcosis and Decompression Sickness).Essential Skills: A look at equalization techniques like the Frenzel and Valsalva maneuvers.Direct Comparison: A clear breakdown of the differences in mindset, equipment, and risks between freediving and scuba.üõ†Ô∏è Technologies UsedThis project was built with modern, simple web technologies:HTML5: For the core structure of the presentation.Tailwind CSS: For all styling and creating a clean, modern UI.JavaScript: To handle slide navigation and interactive features.Google Gemini API: To power the dynamic content on the "Dive Site Assistant" and "Safety Quiz" slides.This project was created to share a passion for the underwater world through the lens of science and engineering. Feel free to explore, learn, and get inspired for your own adventures!
